# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## 📚 Description

This project focuses on mastering modern JavaScript (ES6) data manipulation techniques using array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, as well as advanced data structures such as `Set`, `Map`, `WeakMap`, and Typed Arrays.

By completing this project, you will gain the ability to write cleaner, more efficient, and scalable code for handling and transforming data, which is a vital skill in frontend, backend, and full-stack JavaScript development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6
- Node.js (v12.11.x)
- Jest (for unit testing)
- ESLint (Airbnb style guide)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

## 📈 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

✅ Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays  
✅ Create and work with Typed Arrays for low-level data handling  
✅ Utilize `Set` to store unique values and remove duplicates  
✅ Use `Map` for flexible key-value storage  
✅ Understand `WeakMap` and its garbage collection advantages
