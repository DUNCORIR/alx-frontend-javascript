# 0x02. ES6 Classes

## Description

This project introduces the concept of **classes in ES6 JavaScript**, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, static methods, and metaprogramming. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with modern class syntax and understand how to structure reusable and scalable code.

All code is intended to run on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**, tested with **Jest**, and linted with **ESLint**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- âœ… Define and instantiate ES6 classes using the `class` and `constructor` keywords.
- âœ… Add instance methods and understand how they work across different objects.
- âœ… Use and explain the purpose of `static` methods.
- âœ… Extend a class using the `extends` keyword and invoke parent methods using `super()`.
- âœ… Understand and apply **symbols** in class design to create unique, hidden keys.
- âœ… Leverage **metaprogramming** with `Proxy` and `Reflect` to intercept and customize object behavior.
